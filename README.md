# Utter-Bull-Deprecated
My very first app project, a prototype version of the "Utter Bull" game app made natively in Android Studio, essentially completely finished, as of April 2020. Since superseded by the Unity version which went on to be published.

Was not built to handle lifecycle events at all, so the game suffers from not resuming if stopped for any reason. The planned opening tutorial also had some technical difficulties in building. The Unity version addresses both of these issues.

Status: Deprecated
